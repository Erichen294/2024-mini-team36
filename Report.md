Exercise 01
    1. what are the "max_bright" and "min_bright" values you found?
        max_bright = 512
        min_bright = 38000
        I also added a if statement to check when the duty_cycle is greater than 0.05 which triggers the led to turn on for duty_cycle * blink_period amount of time. Otherwise the led will turn off if it is dim.

Exercise 02
    1. I added a dictionary of notes to their frequencies and also the song with all the notes in it. I wrote a new function that plays all the notes in the song. The song I chose was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

Exercise 03
    1. I changed N = 10 for 10 trials and after all of them were done I calculated average by summing all the times and dividing by 10, used min function to find the minimum, and used max function to find the maximum. 
    2. Here is an example of the cloud service storing the score, average, minimum, and maximum of one run. Note: The last point of each graph is the trial run in question. The other points were testing. You can see that the sscore, average, minimum, and maximum are correctly recorded.
