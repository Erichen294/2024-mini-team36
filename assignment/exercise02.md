# Exercise 02 - Connect to WiFi

Often it's desired to use an embedded microcontroller such as the Pico W to connect to the internet.
Often such IoT (Internet of Things) devices may only have the 2.4GHz band.
Also, some of them such as Pico W currently can't use WPA3 security, but do work with WPA2 security.

If your mobile phone has a "mobile hotspot" feature, you can use it to create a WiFi network for the Pico W to connect to.
Ensure as above that WPA2 is available--WPA2 / WPA3 mixed mode is also fine.
Ensure that the mobile hotspot is on 2.4 GHz band.
