# 2024 Fall Hardware Miniproject

This project uses the Raspberry
[Pi Pico WH](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html#raspberry-pi-pico-w-and-pico-wh)
(wireless, with header pins).
A breadboard, Pi Pico WH, photocell, resistor, and wire kit are provided to each hardware miniproject student for the
[circuit](./doc/circuit.md).
Each student must provide a USB cable that connects to their macOS, Windows, or Linux laptop and has a micro-USB connector on the other end to plug into the Pico.
The student laptop is used to program the Pico.
The laptop software works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

This miniproject focuses on using
[MicroPython](./doc/micropython.md)
using
[Thonny IDE](./doc/thonny.md).
Other IDE can be used, including Visual Studio Code or
[rshell](./doc/rshell.md).
