# Miniproject assignment

This assignment uses the Raspberry Pi Pico H (non-W no wireless version) as handed out in class.
Feel free to use AI assistants if you wish such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.

Each student team, please fork this "2024-hw-mini" repository.
Then `git clone` your forked repository to your local machine as you write your code and results.
The **final submission will be a link to your forked GitHub repository** containing your code and JSON files as specified in the exercises and projects below.
For question responses please make a top-level "Report.md" file in your forked GitHub repository.
If you choose to make your GitHub repository "Private", then you would need to add my GitHub username
[drhirsch](https://github.com/drhirsch)
under Repository Settings as a read-only Collaborator

In this Git repository, the directory
[python/](../python)
contains MicroPython script that flashes the LED while simultaneously reading onboard temperature, demonstrating multi-threading on the dual-core CPU of the Pi Pico.
