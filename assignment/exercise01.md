# Exercise 01 - MicroPython wireless communication

Python
[modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
provide objects,
[functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions),
and variables within a namespace.

MicroPython interpreter comes with a standard library of modules, just like CPython that we use on laptops and  the full Raspberry Pi.
The MicroPython
[network.WLAN](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/network.WLAN.html)
module provides functions to use with the built-in WiFi interface.
The `network.STA_IF` constant is used to configure the WiFi interface as a station (client).
